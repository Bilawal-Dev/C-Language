# C Language Code Repository

## The Beginning of My Software Engineering Journey

This repository marks the start of my journey into software engineering. During my first semester at UET Mardan, I took the Introduction to Programming course where we learned the C language. C, being a low-level language, helped us understand several core concepts like memory management. Coding in C provided us with a strong base for pursuing our future coding journey, improving our logic and coding skills. I learned a lot from this course and really enjoyed it, which led me to take a deep dive into learning and exploring this field further.

## Description

This repository contains the C language code I wrote during my first semester at university. It includes various programs and exercises from my Introduction to Programming course.

## Contents

1. **Basics**: Simple programs to understand the basics of the C language.
2. **Conditions**: Examples of using conditional statements.
3. **Loops**: Programs demonstrating the use of loops.
4. **Functions**: Exercises involving functions.
5. **Arrays**: Programs that utilize arrays.
